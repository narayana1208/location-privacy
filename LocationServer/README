The HTTP server was designed using Java servlet technology for
simplicity.

It is an Eclipse Dynamic Web Project. The source code can be run easily
in Eclipse. Exporting it as a .war file and putting into a servlet
container like Apache Tomcat is relatively straightforward. 
You would compile the server and run it in Apache Tomcat like any kind of servlet.

If you plan on using the code or have question, email frankw at cs dot stanford dot edu. This code does not have support, but I will try my best to answer your questions.
